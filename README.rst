## Setup

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.8 >
- Poetry (package manager)

**Running for the first time:**
1. Run `poetry install`.
2. If on VSCode, set your interpreter (i.e. `cmd/ctrl + shift + x`` -> install "Python" -> `cmd/ctrl + shift + p`` -> then type "Python: Select Interpreter") to the one set by Poetry.
3. Run `poe dev` to start the development environment. This should automatically re-run after you make any code changes.
